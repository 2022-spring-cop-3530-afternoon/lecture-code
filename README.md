# COP 3530 - Data Structures and Algorithms 1
The purpose of this repository is to post the final versions of files created during the lectures.
It's possible that some changes such as bug fixes and other clean-up might make these files slightly different from those in the lectures, but the overall purpose of the code should remain unchanged.

If you are in my class and have questions, please contact me with questions and comments via the communication channels available.
If you are not in my class but have somehow stumbled across this code base...
